Spotify WorldView
-----------------------------------
This application is an extension on the project "Album Availability" which will add functionalities to view the albums available in a country and to generate a playlist of popular, available songs in a country.

[Link to Repository](https://github.com/itstheresa/spotifyWorldView)

Instructions for Setup: 
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open terminal and cd to the spotifyWorldView folder.
3. Enter "rails s"
4. Go to localhost:3000 in your browser.
5. Enjoy Spotify WorldView

How to Use: Search for an album - you will get a list of albums that you can then select from and see the tracklist ordered by popularity, 
as well as see the countries that the album is available in.  The website also leads to a Github page where 
albums can be searched by URI or dragged in from Spotify to then view on the map where an album is available.

Huge limitation was the inability to incorporate the Google Charts javascript used in the original open
source project directly into the Ruby on Rails application, which made it extremely difficult
to implement additional functionalities in the Rails framework.
