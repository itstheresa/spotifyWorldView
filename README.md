Instructions: Open on server csc15. Search for an album - you will get a list of albums that you can then select from and see the tracklist ordered by popularity, as well as see the countries that the album is available in.  The website also leads to a Github page where albums can be searched by URI or dragged in from Spotify to then view on the map where an album is available.
